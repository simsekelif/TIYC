      <h2>How to Play:</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to Tell Me If You Can! 🎉 The goal is simple: get your team to
        guess the <i>"Main Word"</i> without saying any of the
        <i>"Forbidden Words"</i>! Sounds easy, right? Well, there's a catch: you
        only have <u>60</u> seconds! ⏳
      </p>

      <h3>Here's how it works:</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Describe the "Main Word" using clues, gestures, or wild
            storytelling—just don't say those sneaky Forbidden Words! 🚫
          </li>
          <li>
            Your teammates guess as fast as they can while the clock is ticking.
            If they get it right, click "Next" and earn a point! 🎯
          </li>
          <li>
            If you slip up and say a "Forbidden Word", click "Wrong" and lose a
            point! 🙅‍♂️
          </li>
          <li>
            Stuck? Hit "Pass" to skip the card, no points lost, no points
            gained.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
