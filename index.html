       <h2>How to Play:</h2>
       
        <p>Welcome to Tell Me If You Can! 🎉 The goal is simple: get your team to guess the Main Word without saying any of the Forbidden Words! Sounds easy, right? Well, there's a catch—you only have 60 seconds! ⏳</p>
        
        <h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Describe the Main Word using clues, gestures, or wild storytelling—just don’t say those sneaky Forbidden Words! 🚫</li>
        <li>Your teammates guess as fast as they can while the clock is ticking. If they get it right, click Next and earn a point! 🎯</li>
        <li>If you slip up and say a Forbidden Word, click Wrong and lose a point! 🙅‍♂️</li>
        <li>Stuck? Hit Pass to skip the card—no points lost, no points gained.</li>
         </ol>
         <p> to challenge your quick thinking and creative clues? Click Play to dive into the fun and see if you can beat the clock! Good luck! 🍀</p>
