##About the Project
This project is my first step into the web development journey. I have usede HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Responsiveness and accesibilty were also 2 ipmportant keys while developing this project.

##How to Play
**Get Ready:** Gather your friends and pick your team. One player explains the "Main Word" while avoiding the "Forbidden Words".

**Start the Clock:** You have 60 seconds to guess as many points as possible.

**Score or Pass:** Hit "Correct!" if your team guesses the word.
Hit "Wrong!" if a forbidden word is used by mistake.
Stuck? Use "Pass!" to move on without losing a point.

**Win the Glory:** Compete, laugh, and celebrate the winner!
